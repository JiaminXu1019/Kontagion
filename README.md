# Kontagion

Gameplay Details

In Kontagion, Socrates starts out a new game with three lives and continues to play until
all of his lives have been exhausted. There are multiple levels in Kontagion, beginning
with level 1 (NOT zero), and during each level the player (aka Socrates) must cleanse the
Petri dish of bacteria (including all of the bacteria hidden in the pit(s)) completely before
moving on to the next level/dish.

• Left arrow key or the ‘a’ key: Moves Socrates counterclockwise
• Right arrow key or the ‘d’ key: Moves Socrates clockwise
• Space bar: Fires disinfectant spray if Socrates has spray left
• Enter key: Fires the omnidirectional flamethrower if Socrates has flamethrower
charges left
